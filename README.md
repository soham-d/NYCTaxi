# NYC Taxi Demand Predictions

In this project I have used various Machine Learning techniques to forecast demand of NYC yellow cabs in given location and 10 mins interval of the day.

Data source : NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission official website: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

Type: Time series data in CSV files with millions of records.

Key Feature Engineering techniques used:
1. Fourier Transforms
2. Holt - Winter's double and triple exponential smoothing

Evaluation metric - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
Best score - MAPE - 0.0143
